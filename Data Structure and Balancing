#The below code will allow you to assess the strucutre of your dataframe

str(my_data)


#For running a factorial ANOVA, all of the Independent Variables should be saved as factors.

#If the independent variables in the dataset are not saved as factors, the code below will allow you to convert the required variables into factors

data1 <- data1 %>%
  convert_as_factor(IV1, IV2, IV3)
  #The convert as factor command can be used to convert as many variables in the dataset as you need.

#Once again, the structure of the data should be assessed using the str command

#Using the code below, you can generate frequency tables which will allow you to check whether your dataset is balanced or not. The given example is using the heartattack dataframe
#in the datarium library

table(my_data$risk, my_data$gender, my_data$drug)
