#First, the new dataset must be uploaded from the computer and saved as a variable

coffeedata -> read.csv("coffee.csv")

#Afterwards, the ANOVA must be defined
#The portion in the brackets is telling R to calculate the ANOVA with babble as the dependent variable, and accounting for the main effects of milk and sugar,
as well as the interaction.
coffeeaov -> aov(babble ~ milk*sugar, data = coffeedata)

#A longform way of running the above command is below, with the : indicating interactions

coffeeaov -> aov(babble ~ milk + sugar + milk:sugar, data = coffeedata

# Running a type I Anova uses the base anova() function in R, without any modifications. The code to do so is below

anova(coffeaov)

# To run a type I Anova with the order of main effect testing flipped, you have define a new anova variable with the new order, as seen below.

coffeeaov1 -> aov(babble ~ sugar*milk, data = coffeedata)
anova(coffeeaov1)

# Running a type II Anova requires the Anova() function from the car library. The code for doing so is below.

Anova(coffeeaov, type = 2)

#To run a type 3 ANOVA, use the following code

Anova(coffeeaov, type = 3)

##For type II and III ANOVAs, ensure that the Anova() function is being used, rather than the anova() function.
