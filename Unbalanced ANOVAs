# Running a type I Anova uses the base anova() function in R, without any modifications. The code to do so is below

anova(coffeaov)

# Running a type II Anova requires the Anova() function from the car library. The code for doing so is below.

Anova(coffeeaov, type = 2)

#To run a type 3 ANOVA, use the following code

Anova(coffeeaov, type = 3)

##For type II and III ANOVAs, ensure that the Anova() function is being used, rather than the anova() function.
