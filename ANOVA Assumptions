 #The below code can be used to test assumptions in R for Homogeneity of Variance
 
heartattackaov <- aov(cholesterol ~ drug*risk*gender, data = my_data)
#The above line is jsut to define the actual ANOVA. Without defining it, we cannot create any of the tests.
leveneTest(cholesterol ~ gender * risk * drug, data = my_data)
#The above line runs the levene's test.
plot(heartattackaov, 1)
#The above line actually plots the residuals vs the fitted

#The code below can be used to test assumptions in R for the normality of the residuals.

plot(heartattackaov, 2)
#The code above plots all of the residuals so we can see if they are normally distributed
heartattackaov_residuals <- residuals(object = heartattackaov)
#The code above extracts the residuals from the anova so we can run our tests
shapiro.test(x = heartattackaov_residuals)
#The code above actually runs the Shapiro-Wilks Test
