#The code below prints out a summary of the ANOVA function, with SS, DF and P Values
#The anova() function is the base anova function in the stats package in R. It defaults to running a Type I Anova
anova(heartattackaov)

#To get the effect size of eta squared, and partial eta squared, you would use the etaSquared function from the lsr library

etaSquared(heartattackaov, type = 2, anova = FALSE)

#This function will produce both the eta squared, and partial eta squared values. 
#By setting the anova = TRUE, we can also print out the ANOVA along with the effect sizes
#Currently, this is running a type 2 ANOVA. For balanced designs, this makes no difference, but for unbalanced designs it has an effect.
